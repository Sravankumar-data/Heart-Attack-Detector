# IoT-Based Heart Attack Detector Band with Real-Time Alerts

A wearable IoT smart band designed to detect heart attack symptoms and instantly alert family members and nearby hospitals, while also displaying the user's vitals on a screen. This life-saving wearable combines continuous health monitoring with smart communication for proactive emergency response.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- **Continuous Heart Rate Monitoring**  
  Utilizes a pulse sensor to track heart rate in real time.

- **Live Vitals Display**  
  Heart data and warnings are shown instantly on an OLED/LED screen.

- **Wi-Fi Communication via NodeMCU (ESP8266)**  
  Enables seamless wireless connectivity for remote alerts and data transmission.

- **Automatic Alerts**  
  Instantly notifies family members and nearby hospitals via email, SMS, or API integrations if abnormal heart activity is detected.

- **Compact, Low-Power Wearable**  
  Designed for comfort, portability, and energy efficiency for everyday use.

## üîç What I Explored

- **Signal Processing for Health Data**  
  Extracted, processed, and analyzed heart signals to detect emergencies.

- **Emergency Alerting Integration**  
  Used Blynk, Twilio, and HTTP APIs to build a robust, automatic alert system.

- **Real-Time User Interface & IoT Dashboard**  
  Developed both local (on-device) and remote user interfaces for live vital tracking.

- **Designing for Reliability & Quick Response**  
  Engineered the system with a focus on consistent performance and minimum emergency response times.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- NodeMCU (ESP8266)
- Pulse sensor
- OLED/LED display module
- Blynk, Twilio, and HTTP APIs
- Arduino IDE

## üì¶ How It Works

1. **Wear the Band:**  
   The pulse sensor continuously measures your heart rate.

2. **View Vitals Instantly:**  
   Heart rate data and critical alerts are displayed on the band‚Äôs screen.

3. **Automatic Emergency Alerts:**  
   Abnormal readings trigger instant alerts to registered family members and nearby hospitals.

4. **Remote Monitoring:**  
   Optionally, data is sent to an IoT dashboard for caregivers and medical staff.

## üåç Impact

This project is a step toward next-generation life-saving wearables‚Äîcombining real-time health tracking with instantaneous smart communication to ensure safety and peace of mind for users and their loved ones.
